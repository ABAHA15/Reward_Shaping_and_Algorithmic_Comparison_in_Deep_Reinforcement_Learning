# Reward_Shaping_and_Algorithmic_Comparison_in_Deep_Reinforcement_Learning
A comprehensive study of reward shaping and algorithmic behavior in Deep Reinforcement Learning. The project compares value-based, policy-gradient, and actor–critic methods on the CartPole benchmark and evaluates learned policies in custom GridWorld and Pacman-style environments using interactive GUI visualizations.
